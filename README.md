# BelleBeat-Case-Study
Track A (2nd option) for Google data analytics capstone project.

This is a case study on smart fitness devices to find trends that can be applied to products and marketing strategies in the company Bellebeat.
The case study has 6 main sections, namely: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. Each section documents each phase of the data analysis process that I performed in this case study.
