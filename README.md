This is a case study on smart fitness device usage data to find insights that can
be applied to products and marketing strategies in the company Bellebeat.
The case study has 6 main sections, namely: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
Each section documents each phase of the data analysis process that I performed in this case study.

### <ins>Data Sources</ins>
Datasets that I used: Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data by MÃ¶bius and Wearable Health Performance Data by Pratyush Puri.

### <ins>Links to the Datasets</ins>
 Here are the links for both of the datasets used in this case study: [Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/data/), [Wearable Health Device Performance Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratyushpuri/wearable-health-devices-performance-analysis)

### <ins>Data Integrity</ins>
* Last Updated:
  + The FitBit dataset shows that it was updated last year (2024), but still only shows data from 2016 on the participants.
  + The Wearable Helath Device Performance dataset was last updated June 24, 2025.
    
* How the datasets were generated:
  + FitBit data was provided by 30 FitBit users who consented to FitBit tracker data being collected on them from March 12, 2016 to May 12, 2016
  + Wearable Health Device Performance data is all synthetic and not from real testing. While the data is not real, it is made to be close to the actual data that would be found on ecommerce sites. It does contain real data on the brand name, product name, product model, and device specifications.
    
* How the Data is Stored:
  + FitBit dataset is stored across multiple csv files
  + Wearable Health Device Performance Data is stored in one csv file
    
* Data Citations
  + A citation to where the data was genereated is provided by FitBit Fitness Tracker Data
  + No citations are present on the Wearable health Device Performance dataset as of July 24, 2025
    
* Missing Values
  + Present in some of the data files (csv format) from the FitBit data
  + Present in the GPS_Accuracy_Meters field in the Wearable Health Device Performance data

# Process
### <ins>Tools Used</ins>
* Excel to inspect and clean both datasets
* Google BigQuery to combine and store the cleaned data from the FitBit csv files to get the full time frame (March 12, 2016 to May 12, 2016)
